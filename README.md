2. You can either run the file from the command prompt as `python aalysis.py` or run it in the IDE

**NOTE:**  
The data is given in the folder 'data'. The structure for this is:

root  
 |__ data  
 |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|__ Interactions  
 |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|__ .json files  
 |__ analysis.py  
 
If the folder is not structured this way, then the code will not run.
